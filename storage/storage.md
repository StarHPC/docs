# Storage and backup

## Available file system

Star has a "three folded" file system:

-   Global accessible home area (user area): /home (64 TB)
-   Global accessible work or scratch area: /global/work (1000 TB)
-   Local accessible work or scratch area on each node: /local/work
    (\~450 GB)

## Home area

The file system for user home directories on Star. It is a 64 TB
global file system, which is accessible from both the login nodes and
all the compute nodes. The size of the home directory's for each user is
300 GB. It is not possible to extend the size. If you need more space,
consider using /global/work (see below).

The home area is for "permanent" storage only, so please do not use it
for temporary storage during production runs. Jobs using the home area
for scratch files while running may be killed without any warning.

Warning

</div>

Due to star coming close to its storage limits, starting from July
2020 /global/work will be subject to a auto cleanup affecting all files
older than 21 days.

Starting from first of July we will move all files which havenâ€™t been
accessed for more than 21 days to a trash folder from where they will be
deleted in due time.

We ask you to classify your data in /global/work and move all files you
need to keep to your home folder or other storage options like NIRD. In
order to save storage space consider archiving your data in compressed
form, see `file_compression`.

In case you miss important files that have been moved, please write an
email to <migration@metacenter.no> as we keep the files for some time
and can restore them if needed.

There are two different work/scratch areas available on Star:

-   1000 TB global accessible work area on the cluster, accessible from
    both the login nodes and all the compute nodes as /global/work. This
    is the recommended work area, both because of size and performance!
    Users can stripe files themselves as this file system is a Lustre
    file system.
-   In addition, each compute node has a small work area of
    approximately 450 GB, only locally accessible on each node. This
    area is accessible as /local/work on each compute node. In general
    we do not recommend to use /local/work, both because of (the lack
    of) size and performance, however for some users this may be the
    best alternative.

These work areas should be used for all jobs running on Star.

There is no backup of files stored on the work areas. If you need
permanent storage of large amounts of data, please contact the system
administrators: <support@metacenter.no>

Disk quota is not enforced on work/scratch areas. Please use common
courtesy and keep your work/scratch partitions clean. Move all files you
do not need on Star elsewhere or delete them. Since overfilled
work/scratch partitions can cause problems, files older than 14 days are
subject for deletion without any notice.

Files on /local/work/ belonging to users other than the one that runs a
job on the node will be deleted.

## Backup

There is no real backup of the data on Star. However we do keep daily
snapshots of /home and /project for the last 7 days. The /home snapshots
are kept at /global/hds/.snapshot/

There is no backup of files stored on the /global/work and /local/work
areas. If you need permanent storage of large amounts of data, or if you
need to restore some lost data, please contact the system
administrators: <support@metacenter.no>

## Archiving data

Archiving is not provided. However you may apply for archive space on
[Norstore](https://archive.norstore.no/).

## Closing of user account

User accounts on Star are closed on request from Uninett Sigma or the
project leader. The account is closed in a way so that the user no
longer can log in to Star.

If the user has data needed by other people in the group all data on
/home/ is preserved.

## Privacy of user data

General privacy

There is a couple of things you as a user, can do to minimize the risk
of your data and account on Star being read/accessed from the outside
world.

1.  Your account on Star is personal, do not give away your password
    to anyone, not even the HPC staff.
2.  If you have configured ssh-keys on your local computer, do not use
    passphrase-less keys for accessing Star.

By default a new account on Star is readable for everyone on the
system. That is both /home/ and /global/work/

This can easily be change by the user using the command chmod The chmod
have a lot "cryptic" combinations of options ([click here for a more in
depth explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) ). the most
commonly used is:

-   only user can read their home directory:

        chmod 700 /home/$USER

-   User and their group can read and execute files on the home
    directory:

        chmod 750 /home/$USER

-   User and all others including the group can read and execute the
    files:

        chmod 755 /home/$USER

-   everybody can read, execute, and WRITE to directory:

        chmod 777 /home/$USER

## Management of lage files (\> 200GB)

Some special care needs to be taken if you want to create very large
files on the system. With large we mean file sizes over 200GB.

The /global/work file system (and /global/home too) is served by a
number of storage arrays that each contain smaller pieces of the file
system, the size of the chunks are 2TB (2000GB) each. In the default
setup each file is contained within one storage array so the default
filesize limit is thus 2TB. In practice the file limit is considerably
smaller as each array contains a lot of files.

Each user can change the default placement of the files it creates by
striping files over several storage arrays. This is done with the
following command:

    lfs setstripe -c 4 .

After this has been done all new files created in the current directory
will be spread over 4 storage arrays each having 1/4th of the file. The
file can be accessed as normal no special action need to be taken. When
the striping is set this way it will be defined on a per directory basis
so different directories can have different stripe setups in the same
file system, new subdirectories will inherit the striping from its
parent at the time of creation.

We recommend users to set the stripe count so that each chunk will be
approx. 200-300GB each, for example

| File size  | Stripe count | Command                |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 500-1000GB | 4            | `lfs setstripe -c 4 .` |
| 1TB - 2TB  | 8            | `lfs setstripe -c 8 .` |

Once a file is created the stripe count cannot be changed. This is
because the physical bits of the data already are written to a certain
subset of the storage arrays. However the following trick can used after
one has changed the striping as described above:

    $ mv file file.bu
    $ cp -a file.bu file
    $ rm file.bu

The use of `-a` flag ensures that all permissions etc are preserved.

## Management of many small files (\> 10000)

The file system on Star is designed to give good performance for large
files. This have some impact if you have many small files.

If you have thousands of files in one directory. Basic operations like
'ls' becomes very slow, there is nothing to do about this. However
directories containing many files may cause the backup of the data to
fail. It is therefore highly recommended that if you want backup of the
files you need to use 'tar' to create on archive file of the directory.

## Compression of data

Data which is not accessed frequently like results of finished projects
should be compressed in order to reduce storage space.

We recommend `xz` and `tar` to compress single files or whole folder
structures. To compress a single file:

    $ xz file

To decompress:

    $ xz --decompress file

To create a archive multiple files or folder:

    $ tar cfJv archive.tar.xz files

It is recommended to use the file suffix `.tar.xz` to make it clear that
archive was compressed with `xz`.

To extract a archive (use `-C folder` to extract the files in folder):

    $ tar xvf archive.tar.xz

## Binary data and endianness

Star is like all desktop PCs a little endian computer.

At the moment in NOTUR the only big endian machine is njord.hpc.ntnu.no
so Fortran sequential unformatted files create on Njord cannot be read
on Star.

The best work around for this is to save your file in a portable file
format like [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) or
[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/).

Both formats are supported on star, but you have to load its modules
to use them:

    $ module load netCDF

Or:

    $ module load HDF5
