General Information

Description
-----------

COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® is a general-purpose software platform, based on advanced numerical methods, for modeling and simulating physics-based problems. It is highly visual, based on graphical interfaces - so users are adviced to use either the client installation on their client machine or the remote graphics solution on Stallo.

Usage
-----


COMSOL is a rather memory intensive code, so we would generally advice users to either run their jobs on the highmem-nodes (with 8GB/core of memory) or less than full nodes on the slim nodes.

Use

.. code-block:: bash

    $ module avail COMSOL

to see which versions of COMSOL are available. Use

.. code-block:: bash

 $ module load COMSOL/<version> # i.e 5.3-intel-2016a

to get access to any given version of COMSOL.

The license of comsol is installed as a floating network license type, meaning that there is a server checking out license tokens upon request.
If you want to know whether there are available license tokens or not, load the module as above. Then type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lmstat -c $LMCOMSOL_LICENSE_FILE -a

Happy calculations!
