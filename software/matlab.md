# Matlab

## Introduction

MATLAB is a mathematical software package which can be used for analysing and solving mathematical and engineering problems such as numerical computations, graphs plotting, programming and more.

This guide explains how to start using MATLAB on the **Star HPC Cluster**.
Access to MATLAB is provided through the **Open OnDemand** web portal.

## Login to Open OnDemand
1. Open your browser and navigate to the Star HPC Open OnDemand portal.
2. Log in using your cluster credentials.

## Starting an Interactive Desktop Session
From the Open OnDemand dashboard, select **Interactive Apps → Desktop**.

## Running MATLAB Code

- After MATLAB opens, you can start writing and executing your scripts as usual.
- You can use the editor for `.m` files or run commands directly in the command window.
