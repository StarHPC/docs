# Getting an account

## Getting started on the machine (account, quota, password)

Before you start using the Star cluster, please read Hofstra University's [Acceptable Use Guidelines](http://www.hofstra.edu/scs/aug).

A general introduction to the Star HPC cluster, research community, and support group be found at [starhpc.hofstra.io](https://starhpc.hofstra.io).

## How to get an account and a CPU quota on Star

To be able to work on the Star cluster, you must have an account and you must have been granted CPU time on the system. There are two ways to achieve this:

### Hofstra Quota

“Local users” (i.e. users from Hofstra or affiliated with Hofstra in some
way) can apply for an account and a quota from Hofstra’s share of Star. If
you want to apply for such a quota follow the instructions here:

* [How to get a local account on Star](huquota.html)

### Research Council Quota

Regional users (including users from Hofstra) may apply for an account and a
CPU quota from the Research Council's share of Star. If you want to
apply for such a quota please use this [regional quota form](https://www.example.com/application/project/).
