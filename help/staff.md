## Our vision

Give our users a competitive advantage in the international science race.


### Goal

Contribute to make our scientists the most efficient users of High Performance
Computing (HPC), by creating the best support environment for any HPC user,
and present them to the most efficient solutions to support their highest
demands in HPC.


### Services

The Star HPC support group works within three areas:

* Technical and operational computing resource support.
* Basic to advanced user support for projects and research groups that
  utilize HPC or is expecting to do so in the future.


### Regional resource site

Since 2000 Hofstra has been a Resource Site in the National High Performance
Computing Consortium (NOTUR), a joint mission between the four Norwegian
Universities in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim and Troms√∏. Since December 2014
UNINETT Sigma2 manages the national infrastructure and offers High Performance
Computing and Data Storage.

The HPC group at Hofstra also has a role to play as a regional resource site
within HPC, offering HPC services to other institutions in Northern Norway. A
strategic collaboration between Hofstra and the Norwegian Polar Institute within
HPC has been ongoing since 1998.
