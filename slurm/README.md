# Slurm

Slurm Workload Manager, or SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management), is a free and open-source job scheduler for managing workloads on Linux and Unix-based clusters, grids, and supercomputers. Slurm is widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, where it is used to manage the allocation of resources such as CPU time, memory, and storage across a large number of compute nodes. Slurm provides tools for users to submit, monitor, and control the execution of their jobs. Other key features include support for parallel and serial job execution, support for job dependencies and job arrays, support for resource reservations and QoS (quality of service), and support for job priority and backfilling. Slurm has a modular design that enables it to be highly configurable to be tailored to meet a wide variety of needs in different environments. It is widely used in academia and industry, and is supported by a large and active community of users and developers.
