# About Star

## Overview

The Star HPC Cluster is a computing facility designed for a variety of research and computational tasks. It combines advanced computing **nodes** and a high-speed **storage system** with a suite of **software applications**.

SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is our chosen job scheduler and queueing system that efficiently manages resource allocation, ensuring everyone gets the right amount of resources at the right time. 

Apptainer (formerly Singularity) is also a major application on the cluster. Apptainer is a containerization platform similar to Docker with the major difference that it runs under user privileges instead of `root`. This platform is enhanced by NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud) which provides access to a wide array of pre-built, GPU-optimized software containers for diverse applications. This integration saves all users a lot of time as they donâ€™t need to set up the software applications from scratch and can just pull and use the NGC images with Apptainer.

The cluster also supports various software applications tailored to different needs: Python and R for data analysis, MATLAB for technical computing, Jupyter for interactive projects, and OpenMPI for parallel computing. Anaconda broadens these capabilities with packages for scientific computing, while NetCDF manages large datasets. For big data tasks, Hadoop/Spark offers powerful processing tools.


## Hardware

### Login Node

### Compute Nodes

#### HPE Apollo 6500 Gen10

#### HPE DL365 Gen10

### Storage System

## Our vision

Making complex and time-intensive calculations simple and accessible.


<!-- ### Services

The Star HPC support group works within three areas:

* Technical and operational computing resource support.
* Basic to advanced user support for projects and research groups that utilize HPC or is expecting to do so in the future. -->


### Our Goal

Our heart is set on creating a vibrant community where our High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster is a beacon of collaboration and discovery. We are wishing to provide a supportive space where researchers and students can express their scientific ideas and explore unchanted areas. We are here to make the complicated world of computational research a shared path of growth, learning, and significant discoveries for the ones that are eager to learn.
